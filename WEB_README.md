# Mini JavaScript Engine Web Interface

A web-based graphical user interface for the Mini JavaScript Engine that allows you to write, run, and analyze JavaScript code directly in your browser.

## Features

- **Code Editor**: Write and edit JavaScript code with syntax highlighting
- **Tokenizer/Lexer View**: See how your code is broken down into tokens
- **AST Viewer**: Visualize the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of your code
- **Environment Inspector**: See all variables and their values in different scopes

## Installation and Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd mini-js-engine
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000

2. **Run Code**: Click the "Run" button to execute the code
3. **View Results**: See the results in the various tabs:
   - Output: Shows the result of the code execution
   - Tokens: Displays the tokens generated by the lexer
   - AST: Shows the Abstract Syntax Tree structure
   - Environment: Displays all variables and their values

## Supported JavaScript Features

The Mini JavaScript Engine supports a subset of JavaScript features:
- Variable declarations (let, const)
- Arithmetic & logical expressions (+, -, *, /, &&, ||)
- Conditional statements (if, else)

## Deployment

To build the application for production deployment:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build files will be in the `build` directory, which can be deployed to any static web hosting service.

## Technologies Used

- React.js for the user interface
- CodeMirror for the code editor
- Custom JavaScript compiler implementation
